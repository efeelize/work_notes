do not confuse duty with what other people expect of u;they are utterly diff.
duty is a debt u owe urself to fulfill obligations u have assumed voluntarily.paying that debt can entail anthing from years of patient
work to instant willingness to die.
difficult it maybe,but the reward is self-respect.
